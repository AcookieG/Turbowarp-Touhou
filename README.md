# Turbowarp-Touhou
An old game i made a while ago that uses the Turbowarp game engine. everything gets compiled here so that i can send files easily.

DO NOT ASK FOR THE SOURCE CODE, IT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED.
I won't make a full GitHub release, just download the "maps" folder and a single version of the game, preferably the latest.

Every single sound file has been made by ZUN and the Shanghai Alice team. All credit goes to them. Music from Touhou 6 EoSD.
yes, i am aware a lot of versions are missing. this is partially due to the way i update, being i add 1 for small updates and get up a digit for bigger updates.
